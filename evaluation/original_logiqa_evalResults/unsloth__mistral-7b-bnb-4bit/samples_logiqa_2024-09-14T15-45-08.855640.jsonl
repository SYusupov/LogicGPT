Looking back through these two genetic materials, we can find that all men have a common male ancestor \"Y chromosome Adam\", and all women have a common female ancestor \"mitochondrial Eve\". The researchers conducted genome sequencing and comparative analysis of 69 males from nine different populations, such as Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and found that this male common ancestor \"Y chromosome Adam\" was formed about 156,000 to 120,000 years ago. Using the same technical analysis of mitochondria, the researchers also calculated that this female common ancestor \"mitochondrial Eve\" was formed between 148,000 and 99,000 years ago.\nQuestion: Which of the following is most appropriate as a corollary of the above discussion?\nChoices:\nA. \"Y chromosome Adam\" and \"mitochondrial Eve\" were formed in the same period, and \"age\" is close, \"Y chromosome Adam\" may be earlier.\nB. 15 years ago, there was only one man \"Adam\" on earth\nC. As two individuals, \"Adam\" and \"Eve\" should never meet\nD.
